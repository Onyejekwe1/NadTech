ShopsRUs is an existing retail outlet. They would like to provide discount to their customers on all their web/mobile platforms. They require a set of APIs to be built that provide capabilities to calculate discounts, generate the total costs and generate the invoices for customers.

# steps to run the app for API:
1. Add missing nugget packages (if any)
2. The project was built with Sqlite, so the DB is already attached to the project
3. Run application and test

# steps to run the app for client:
1. Add missing node packages
3. Run application and test
